"""The Clinical Hub's publish gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The Clinical Hub publishes to nurses, and Stay Current is the part that changes
without anyone looking at it: tools/refresh_stay_current.py rewrites
stay-current-data.json on a schedule, and sources-registry.json is the record of
what the Hub claims to watch. Two things can go wrong quietly.

  1. THE REGISTRY DRIFTS FROM WHAT ACTUALLY RUNS. On 28/08/2026 the RCN's news
     listing was being scraped and published on the page with no entry in the
     registry at all, while the registry's own preamble said everything it holds
     had been placed against a panel. A registry that is not the full picture is
     worse than no registry, because it is read as one.

  2. THE PAGE GOES STALE OR HALF-EMPTY WITHOUT SAYING SO. The refresher already
     keeps the previous items when a source yields nothing, which is the right
     call — but a reader cannot tell carried-over items from fresh ones, so
     nothing outside this gate would notice a parser that had been dead for a
     month.

Nothing here fetches anything. It reads the files as published, so it runs in a
second, offline, and can sit in front of a deploy.

Run:  python3 site/tools/clinical_verify.py
Exit: 0 clean (warnings allowed), 1 on any failure.
